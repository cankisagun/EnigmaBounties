# Enigma Bounty Program

We’re excited to announce our first bounty program!

  
This initial effort focuses on creating the building blocks for secret contract development. 
This should result in several open-sourced repos that feature sample secret contracts (written in Rust!) and a simple client-side UI (using Enigma-JS).

## Bounty Guidelines

Bounty submissions should contain well-documented code that can be followed along easily by another developer.
  
These bounties will become part of our educational resources moving forward, and will be available to future developers as examples, inspiration, and starting points.

**Please complete the application process before starting work** -- we will be reviewing pre-submission materials and initially selecting just one applicant at a time for each bounty. 

## Current Bounties

In this batch, we’re funding work on these particular applications:

-   Secret Access-Control
    
-   Secret Benchmarking
    
-   Non-Fungible Token Lottery
    
-   Secret Data Validation
    
-   Rock-Paper-Scissors

Each application is described in more detail inside the respective issue.
